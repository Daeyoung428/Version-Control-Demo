# Residential House with Unity 2020

Unity 2020.2.0f1 with HDRP를 템플릿으로 Residential House의 Interactive Work-Though와 HMD를 착용한 가상현실을 구현한다.

## 1. Asset Create and Management

The courses in this series will help you prepare for the Unity Certified 3D Artist exam, the professional certification for entry- to mid-level Unity artists. 3D artists are critical to the Unity development pipeline. They are a bridge between the programmers writing the application code and the designers or art directors who define the application’s aesthetics and style. In these courses, you will be challenged to complete realistic art implementation tasks in Unity that are aligned to the topics covered on the exam. Throughout this first course, you will be tasked with completing the asset setup for a Kitchen Configurator application - an app that lets users view a realistic rendering of a kitchen and swap out objects and materials to customize the design. The first steps will find you importing assets into a Unity project, troubleshooting common import issues, and tweaking the materials. Finally, you’ll create and organize Prefabs in a way that will work with the application code. By the end of the course, you’ll have a clean and organized Unity project that is ready for the next stage: lighting. You should be proficient at importing assets into Unity from Digital Content Creation \(DCC\) tools, prototyping scenes, working with lighting, and adding particles and effects. You should also have a basic understanding of 2D asset management, animation, and working with scripts. You should have experience in the full product development lifecycle, and understand multi-platform development, including for XR \(AR and VR\) platforms.

### 1. 1. Asset Import and Configuration

For the first part of the course, you'll get an introduction to the course and its Challenge/Solution format, then jump into importing and configuring assets for the Kitchen Configurator project.

### 1. 2. Material Creation

In this section, you'll review the project assets to ensure that all materials were imported correctly. You may have to make some special tweaks of the materials settings in order to get the materials to match the desired specifications.

### 1. 3. Prefab Creation

Next, you'll create and configure Unity prefabs for the objects in the kitchen scene, using the appropriate hierarchies and naming conventions to work with the project code.
